### **[Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html)**

[Link](https://www.getpaint.net/)
just because its called `paint.net`, its a tiny bit confusing, but the URL is <https://www.getpaint.net/>, so keep that in mind. It is also free, open source, and supports plugins. you will want to see the `plugin list` later in this post! It is one of the simplest tools to use for windows

### MS paint

alright I cant say much about this but you can use it if you want. its free and already installed on all windows machines at the moment, go wild

### aseprite

<https://www.aseprite.org/> the main pro of aseprite is the wide range of customizability, access to direct tutorials, and high fidelity for animation and general pixel art. this is a paid option, but can be bought on steam, aseprite's website, and many other places `list needed` along with support for windows, mac, and linux

### gimp

<https://www.gimp.org/> gimp is free, has wide support for plugins, and has a lot of tutorials as well. `needs extending`. gimp also has support for windows, mac, and linux

### Footnotes

This is also a place to mention some FAQs:

> some creators have specific links, others dont, why is that?

This is because their content on that platform isnt centered around this specific topic only, they may have good resources for similar topics, but for example, MortMort doesnt make many pixel art tutorials anymore, so I linked to his playlist and still mentioned him, this usually means that they have good specific stuff and new content from him should be considered but its unlikely to be created specifically for this post's ultility

this also is the case for people's secondary platforms, if they dont have soley pixel art content on a second platform, linking to their youtube is likely good enough, the platform is there, but if theres politics or other non-useful resources I dont want to spam you with them
