### **[Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html)**

[Link](https://www.getpaint.net/)
just because its called `paint.net`, its a tiny bit confusing, but the URL is <https://www.getpaint.net/>, so keep that in mind. It is also free, open source, and supports plugins. you will want to see the `plugin list` later in this post! It is one of the simplest tools to use for windows

### MS paint

alright I cant say much about this but you can use it if you want. its free and already installed on all windows machines at the moment, go wild

### aseprite

<https://www.aseprite.org/> the main pro of aseprite is the wide range of customizability, access to direct tutorials, and high fidelity for animation and general pixel art. this is a paid option, but can be bought on steam, aseprite's website, and many other places `list needed` along with support for windows, mac, and linux

### gimp

<https://www.gimp.org/> gimp is free, has wide support for plugins, and has a lot of tutorials as well. `needs extending`. gimp also has support for windows, mac, and linux
