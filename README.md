## Palettes and Colors

a list of free to use palettes, along with resources for colors and color theory

A good place to start if you want to use someone else's color palette is [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list), it has a lot of public palettes, and theyre usually pretty good! sorting by `Downloads` is a good way to find some decent palettes, but soem general ones I like are listed in a chart below:

### Premade Palettes

Palette Name | Notes
--|--
[ENDESGA 36](https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-36)| see [Endsega's](https://lospec.com/endesga) profile for more

### Custom Colors

If you want to make your own colors, see some tutorials from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLesud3jd5eXTeO3XkF1vOZzVGYsqG6APA). More help for creating color palettes can be found on [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/) for help generating colors from a base color, our `Wiki` also has some base palettes that are free to use

### Footnotes

#### FAQ

This is also a place to mention some FAQs:

> some creators have specific links, others dont, why is that?

```1
This is because their content on that platform isnt centered around this specific topic only, they may have good resources for similar topics, but for example, MortMort doesnt make many pixel art tutorials anymore, so I linked to his playlist and still mentioned him, this usually means that they have good specific stuff and new content from him should be considered but its unlikely to be created specifically for this post's ultility

this also is the case for people's secondary platforms, if they dont have soley pixel art content on a second platform, linking to their youtube is likely good enough, the platform is there, but if theres politics or other non-useful resources I dont want to spam you with them
